### Javascript & Gatsby course website

https://js-gatsby-course.netlify.app/tund1

In the summer 2020 I volunteered in the local library to give two batches of two-month long courses.

- 10 adults and 14 students attended the course
- Participants learned to code a website in Gatsby framework
- Recognized with the award Volunteer of the Year from Notice the Volunteer (MÃ¤rka Vabatahtlikku) foundation


### Website Functionality
- Integrated interactive tests and codepen iframes to practice coding 
- Slideshow integrated into the website so no need to download a file
