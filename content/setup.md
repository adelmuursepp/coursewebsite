Before everything, we need to install the tools we will need to work on our Gatsby project.

# Introduction to Web Development
What is web development and why it is important: [Slides]()

# What are we doing?
Each kind of web development project requires its own specific installations and environment.
It will seem confusing and overwhelming, but don't worry. Installing everything will help us do the development very easily and fast.

# Installations
We are going to install everything as specified on Gatsby website: [Installation Guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)

# Creating Gatsby website
Follow the guide and create the Hello World website yourself. Change the title on your page to different text. Try changing the colors and size in Google Chrome.
